          A cat lover's paradise, Aoshima is an island in Japan's Ehime prefecture. The island is
          famous for the large quantity of semi-tame cats that inhabit the island. Perfect for a
          short day trip, the island is only about half a square kilometre in size, and 1.6km long.
          Stepping off the ferry onto the island,

        The island contains many abandoned buildings and ruined homes to explore. Additionally, the
        overgrown state of much of the area produces an almost eerily tranquil feeling. Coupled with
        the many resident cats, usually seen basking in the sun or enjoying afternoon an nap, it
        seems as though Aoshima is an island being reclaimed by natural forces.
        <p>
          Currently the feline residents outnumber the humans 20:1. Efforts to spay and neuter the
          cats on the island to prevent further inbreeding has resulted in the cat population
          decreasing in recent years, so this unique location is unlikely to survive for much
          longer.

        Aoshima was first settled in the mid 1600's. Originally a sardine fishing village, Aoshima
        was plagued with rodents. In an effort to reduce the rodent population, the fishermen who
        inhabited the island adopted stray cats from other ports and brought them to live on
        Aoshima. The island's residents greatly appreciated the cats for their rodent control
        services, and took good care of the new resident felines. Over time, uncontrolled breeding
        caused the population of the island's feline residents to vastly outnumber the dwindling
        human residents, who left largely due to an economic decline common in rural communities. At
        one point inhabited by more than 200 friendly but semi-feral cats, the cat population has
        been decreasing at a steady pace after a 2018 initiative to spay and neuter all the cats on
        the island. Resulting from this, as of December 2024, the cat population is down to just 80
        felines.

        Aoshima is accessible by a ferry that departs for Aoshima twice daily and only has one
        return trip in the afternoon. The ferry departs from Port Nagahama, and will run you ¥1,360
        for a round trip. A one way trip takes approximately 35 minutes. There are a limited amount
        of seats on the ferry, so be sure to arrive early for the afternoon return ferry to ensure
        you are able to leave the island. If you do get stuck on the island overnight, there is a
        morning return ferry that departs Aoshima at 8:45AM. The ferry is cancelled in poor weather
        conditions, so plan ahead to avoid any hiccups during your visit.

          Port Nagahama is accessible by train, as Iyo-Nagahama Station is just 5 minutes walking
          distance. Iyo-Nagahama Station is on the Yosan Line, which also stops in the nearby
          Matsuyama city. Getting to Matsuyama is relatively easy, as the city has its own airport
          and is well-connected by train and air to major Japanese cities like Nagoya, Osaka and
          Tokyo.

          Despite it's global popularity, Aoshima is not considered a tourist attraction. The island
          has very few residents and no shops, restaurants or cafes. There are also no overnight
          accommodations for tourists on Aoshima, so be sure to catch that final ferry at 4:15PM!
          Bring your own food and beverages for a simple picnic or midday snack while exploring, and
          be sure to bring any trash you make back with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are small hotels available in the port town Nagahama, most tourists would have
          a better experience staying in a larger city like Matsuyama and taking an early afternoon
          train to catch the 2:30PM ferry to Aoshima from Nagahama. Look for accommodations near
          Mastuyama City Station to make catching transportation smooth during your trip.

        Despite lacking the usual tourist amenities, Aoshima truly is a unique experience. That
        isn't to say there isn't plenty to see on the island. The harbour of the island features a
        gorgeous rocky beach, and the remaining traces of the community that once lived on the
        island make for an interesting afternoon of exploring. The island has multiple small shinto
        shrines, and a buddhist temple that tourists may visit. The eastern end of the island has a
        small memorial for a seaplane accident, and the western end has the Aoshima lighthouse, a
        scenic spot for adventurous visitors to enjoy. Of course, spending time with the resident
        cats is the largest draw for visitors to the island, and visitors often bring their own toys
        and cat food to befriend the island's cats. Be sure to respect the resident's rules and only
        feed the cats at the <a href="#feedingarea">designated feeding area</a> by the island
        community centre.

        In Japanese folklore, cats are considered lucky and auspicious. Aoshima isn't the only cat
        island amongst Japan's many islands, there's even a term for islands like Aoshima,
        "nekojima" which means to "cat island".
